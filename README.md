This project is a research survey which collects the data of students studying at Uiowa to see which like to party and what are their prefrences. It collects the data about music preference, bars, days and what major they are in. Depending on this survery we can also draw conslusion on which gender of students like to party more.

Some of the good practices I used are:

I did not ask for data which is not required such as ethnicity, students at Uiowa come from all over the world so it is not required for this survery.
I also did not ask for biology and just gender instead giving the options of Male, Female and Non-binary so that everyone feels included also this was sufficient.
Used the for attribute.
Asked for information which was important and required for research.
